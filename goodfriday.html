            <p class="goodetailsp">Good Friday 2022: Know all about what is good in Good Friday when it is a day of mourning for Christians, 
                its date this year along with its history, significance and everything else you need to know about observing
                Black Friday, Great Friday, Easter Friday or Holy Friday. Good Friday is a significant day for the Christian 
                community and is also known as Great Friday, Holy Friday, Easter Friday or Black Friday, since it commemorates 
                the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Now the question arises - if the day has such a sad history, why is it known 
                as Good Friday? The etymology of the term good in Good Friday is contested in various circles. Some say good
                means pious or holy as Christians believe that the death of Jesus signifies forgiveness for all of the sins of 
                mankind with Jesus sacrificing himself for the good of humankind and that is why the day is also known as Holy 
                Friday as it denotes that Christ suffered and died for his people. Others say that it is a modification of God 
                Friday and that the term actually came from the words God's Friday.

                Good Friday is observed as a public holiday in various countries such as India, Canada, the UK, Germany, Australia, 
                Bermuda, Brazil, Finland, Malta, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and Sweden among others.
